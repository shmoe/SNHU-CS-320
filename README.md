Portfolio containing the work I did in SNHU class CS-320: Testing and Automation

## How can I ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure?
As a developer, I can best ensure my code is functional and secure by following good coding practices and writing comprehensive unit tests that follow the project requirements.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs requires good communication skills and an open channel of discourse with the client. A client's requirements can change, and in the rare cases where a client knows exactly what they want, they may not have the skills required to communicate said needs to the developer properly. As a result the onus falls on the developer or project manager to actively figure out what those needs are by communicating with the client.

## How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is design first, code later. Often if I design concurrently with coding I can get caught in the weeds of optimising the design of small inconsequential parts of the code base and do not spend enough time looking at the big picture. As a result, the best approach for me is to design my software in broad strokes based on the functional requirements, then refine the smaller design elements as I code.
